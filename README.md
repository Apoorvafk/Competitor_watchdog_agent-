Competitor Watch Dog

AI-powered competitor monitoring agent built with LangGraph & Gemini 2.5 Flash

Overview

Competitor Watch Dog is a LangGraph-based AI backend that automatically monitors competitor websites for new information (feature launches, pricing changes, updates, etc.), drafts a recommended response plan, and posts it to a Discord channel for human approval.

The project implements a two-agent workflow:

Scraping Agent â€“ scrapes competitor sites, detects changes, and computes diffs.

Response Agent â€“ interprets those changes, drafts an actionable plan, and posts it to Discord.

You can run it directly from your terminal â€” no frontend required yet.
Approved actions are logged as structured JSON payloads for downstream workflows (e.g., blog tasks, marketing actions, CRM updates).

Node	Description
Scraping Agent	Fetches target site via Playwright, extracts normalized text blocks, and computes a SHA256 content hash. If unchanged from last snapshot (in SQLite), returns NO_CHANGE.
Response Agent	Scores differences by relevance, drafts concise bullet-style actions (â‰¤1200 chars), and sends an approval message to Discord via bot webhook.
Orchestrator	Manages state transitions, database persistence, and conditional edges in LangGraph.
